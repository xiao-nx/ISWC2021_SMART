Brief introdution of this challenge:
Answer type classification plays a key role in question answering, it aims to do, because identify the  expected answer type so that filter irrelevant information, which notably increases the performance of QA systems. A granular answer type classification is possible with popular Semantic Web ontologies such as DBepdia (~760 classes) and Wikidata (~50K classes). In this challenge, given a question in natural language, the task is to predict type of the answer using a set of candidates from a target ontology.

We present our appoarch to predict types from an ontology for questions. The workflow of our solution is below:

## How to use our code? 

* Step0: data_analysis.ipynb: Simple data analysis. 

* Step1: run BERT_classifier_5classes.ipynb to get category classification model.

* Step2: run bert_resources_top.py to get general answer type rediction model for resource category. 

* Step3: run bert_resources_bottom.py to get specific answer type rediction model for resource category. 

* Step4: run Combined_prediction.ipynb to combine all the models to predicae the final results.
